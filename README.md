[Live Demo](https://happy-ramanujan-aca9c0.netlify.app/ "Live Demo")

PeachTree Chats is a Chat Application optimized for both mobile and desktop that allows users create a temporary username
and join chat rooms where they can message in real time with one another. This was
my first project incorporating socket.io and I thoroughly enjoyed learning how to integrate
it and the functionality that it provides.

## Technologies

- React.js (frontend)
- Node.js (backend)
- Socket.io (duplex communication)
